# ClimbCircle

ClimbCircle is a platform that aggregates access to rock climbing and bouldering gyms in Singapore, doubling as an avenue for like minded hobbyists to connect over a social platform. Instead of purchasing multiple gym membership packages across rock climbing and bouldering gyms in Singapore, subscribers can choose to pay a lower monthly fee to gain access to a wider range of rock climbing and bouldering facilities. 

ClimbCircle aims to enhance the experience of rock climbing and bouldering by enabling subscribers to preview climbing and bouldering routes in advance, secure gym slots through booking online, view community-aggregated ratings and reviews, and connect with other like minded hobbyists, all from the convenience of ClimbCircleâ€™s mobile platform.
